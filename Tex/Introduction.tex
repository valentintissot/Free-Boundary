Few words on option pricing (challenge etc)

Structure.




% \section{Framework and Notation}
% Let $\Lambda := \bigcup_{t\in[0,T]}\Lambda_t$,  with the Skorokhod spaces $\Lambda_t = \calD([0,t],\R^d)$ for some $T>0$ and $d\in \N$. Put another way, $\Lambda$ is the collection of all càdlàg paths  with various lengths.   In the financial applications, we will interpret $X$ as a vector of  stock prices or the random sources driving the latter.  Moreover, $T$ will usually seen as the maturity of a contingent claim.
% We adopt the following notation: Given $X_t\in \Lambda_t$, $X_s$ denotes the whole trajectory up to time $s\le t$, while $x_s= X_t(s)$ is the value at time $s$. We equip $\Lambda$ with a $\sigma-$algebra $\calF$, filtration $\F$ and probability measure $\Q$ %(e.g., the Wiener measure) 
% to form a stochastic basis $(\Lambda,\calF,\F, \Q)$. The price vector is therefore the coordinate process. 

%We therefore work with the canonical setting.
