%\subsection{Level Set Representation}
Let us present how our method applies to common contracts traded on options exchanges or over-the-counter. % (OTC). 
Throughout this section,  the payoff function is assumed to be  of the form%\footnote{With a slight abuse of notation, we may also write $\varphi(z), \ \alpha(z), \, \beta(z)$ with $x=(z,\nu)$.   } 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:payoff}
    \varphi(x) = \left( \eta  (\alpha(x) - \beta(x)-K)\right)^+, \quad x = (z,\nu), 
\end{equation}
where $\alpha, \beta: \calX \to \R_+$ 
are nonnegative projection maps independent of $\nu$. Recall that we may regard $\varphi$ as a function of $z$ only and the same holds for $\alpha$ and $\beta$.  %Again, we assume that 
The function $\beta$ is used to encompass spread options (\cref{ex:spread}) and  floating strike options (\cref{ex:Asian,ex:lookback}). Moreover, the parameter  $\eta \in \{\pm 1\}$ determines the option type (call  if $\eta=1$ and  put  if $\eta=-1$).
%This class of payoffs encompasses vanilla and most of the exotic options.
