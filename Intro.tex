Similar to \cite{Becker1,Becker2}, we solve the optimal stopping problem by employing the \textit{Deep Monte Carlo Optimization} method. This was  first introduced by \citet{HanJentzenE} to solve high-dimensional semilinear PDEs; see also \cite{Germain} for an error analysis and alternative schemes. The algorithm can be adapted to parametrize  stochastic controls \cite{HanE} (+Hure , Warin) yielding impressive results  in quadratic hedging  (Warin) and the  Merton portfolio problem  \cite{ReppenSoner}. See also \cite{ReppenSonerTissot} for a survey.     %, %together with continually improving computers, impressive approximation capabilities in recent years.
