\section*{Conclusion}
We shed further light on the approximation of path functionals. After a  review of Hilbert projections and a connection with the path signature, we show the power of the Karhunen-Loève expansion to parsimoniously simulate path-dependent payoffs. 
Further work would include the use of copulas in the  KLMC algorithm to capture the dependence between the $L^2([0,T])$ coefficients of the Karhunen-Loève expansion and a performance comparison with signature-based methods.
