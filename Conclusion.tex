\section{Conclusion}  

We propose an alternative method to solve %(possibly high-dimensional) 
optimal stopping problems. Blending geometric properties of the stopping region with powerful computational tools, we achieve results in line with or above benchmarks. Interestingly, low-dimensional problems (Bermudan put option on one asset) were usually harder to train than high-dimensional ones (max options). Also,
